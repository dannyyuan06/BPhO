# BPhO Computational Challenge 2023 Submission - Danny Yuan

## Challenge 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

These challenges are all done in Python with matplotlib because I felt like it was easier to do in python which is a language which I work with in school.

You will find these challenges in the pythonplots directory.

## Challenge 6, 7

The bulkier challenges are done in Javascript + React + Vite as I am more familiar with javascript than I am with python. I used a threejs coupled with threejs-fiber for React support.

## Set up and run
To run the React app, run

`cd solarsystemorbits`

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

This will run on http://localhost:5173

## Production environment

This project is hosted with Firebase at https://orbits-2aa96.web.app/
